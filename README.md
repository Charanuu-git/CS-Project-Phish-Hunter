### **Email Phishing: The Digital Catfish You Need to Dodge** 

Imagine you get an email that looks **legit**â€”maybe from your bank, Amazon, or even your boss. But plot twist: itâ€™s actually a **scammer** trying to finesse your personal info. Thatâ€™s email phishing, and itâ€™s basically the cyber version of getting catfished.  

### **How They Try to Play You:**  
ðŸ”¹ **"Urgent! Your account is in danger!"** â€“ They create fake panic so you act fast without thinking.  
ðŸ”¹ **"Click this link to verify your details."** â€“ That link? Itâ€™s a trap. Clicking it could steal your login info.  
ðŸ”¹ **"Congrats! You won a prize!"** â€“ No, you didnâ€™t. They just want your data.  
ðŸ”¹ **Fake attachments** â€“ Opening them could install malware on your device.  

### **How to Stay Safe:**  
âœ… **Check the sender** â€“ If the email is from "support@bank123.com" instead of your actual bank, ðŸš©.  
âœ… **Hover over links** â€“ Before clicking, hover over them to see where they really lead.  
âœ… **Never share passwords** â€“ No legit company will ask for them via email.  
âœ… **Use multi-factor authentication (MFA)** â€“ Even if they get your password, MFA keeps them out.  
âœ… **Trust your gut** â€“ If it feels sus, it probably is.

Phishing is one of the biggest cyber threats, and Gen Z is actually **more vulnerable** than older generations because weâ€™re always online. Stay sigma G, donâ€™t get played, and if an email feels offâ€”**just delete it**. ðŸš«ðŸ“©
